Refactoring for loops to LINQ

Language integrated query (LINQ) was first introduced into the .NET framework 3 years ago in 2007. It taken time for developers to fully grasp its power. On release it was promoted as a way to integrate database and XML querying into the language. However, for me its been an introduction into a more functional approach to programming. Recently, I have become more of a polygot programmer - exploring and using langauges such as Javascript, Ruby and F#. These languages are more upfront about their funcional influences I and now find myself writing C# in a much more functional style.

LINQ introduced a more High level operations on collection - you don't care about how it works. More decl
Linq operations names are based on SQL names - rather than traditional functional programming names


What advantages does a functional approach bring? 
* shorter more concise code
* less (error prone) temporary variables and less code means less errors generally - no/less state
* easier to understand, more declarive code - code which states what you want rather than details of how to achieve it

The bad stuff - 
- debugging
- possible performance issues if you never resolve to list. -> Lazy evaluation problems

In a team environment to realise these advantages your fellow developers must become familar with these functional approaches too. This should get easier over time as functional constructs are now built into most languages. Additionally tools such as Resharper now support automatic refactoring to Linq expressions.


Refer to transfromational mindset

Whenever I see a for or foreach loop in the code I am working I often regard it as a code smell. In many cases it can be refactored into a shorter more meaningful functional version. Often this will reduce the amount of code by 70% to 80%. A key skill to enable you to do this to recognise which type of looping code contruct map to which functional operations.  In this post I will discuss how to this 



Goodbye For Loop
 
* Creating one list from another
* Filtering down data, removing items we dont care about
* Counting the number of time something occurs in a list (usually with a condition) - TODO note that count (and first) allow you to pass in a predicate
* Testing if something is true for any element of a list
* Testing if something is true for all elements of a list
* [TODO] Summing?
* Finding the 'best' element in a list - TODO talk about accumaltor here
* For list of lists flattening them down to a single list
